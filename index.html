    <p> One of the ways I make extra money is by creating virtual tours (360 degree panorama tours for businesses). Businesses pay me to come to there location to photograph. I create the panoramas by taking photos using a wide angle lens on a DSLR camera. Each panorama requires I take a photo, turn the camera 90 degrees and repeat until I've made a full rotation. I then take those photos and stitch them together using a program on my desktop. Once I have a stitched panorama. I link the panoramas together to create a tour using another program. 
        Once completed, I upload the tours to Google Maps, and give the clients the panoramas for them to use on their social media pages. Clients are able to embed the tours from Google directly to their websites.</p>

        <style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!4v1556564761089!6m8!1m7!1sCAoSLEFGMVFpcE54Nmw0RG8wRjJSd0ZIRUVjUUxObENIekdtQnV4ME1iamVfNlht!2m2!1d38.62399210453371!2d-90.18729874739722!3f6.94!4f-8.780000000000001!5f0.4000000000000002' width='600' height='450' frameborder='0' style='border:0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

    
    <p>I've been creating these virtual tours for 3 years. I came across this when I was a real estate agent. While licensed the part of the business that I was most interested in was the tech aspect. 
     I really wanted these virtual tours to become a norm in the industry to make it easier for agents. I believe people who are searching for homes should be able to take virtual tour of a home before ever stepping foot inside.</p>
    
    <p>While creating this page I realized that I have been relying heavily on iframes to embedd these virtual tours on clients websites, and onto my wordpress site. I remember Mike saying that iframes are not a good thing, and other people in class agreed. 
    Before adding the iframe to this page, I spent about 30 minutes researching 'Why are iframes bad?' The conclusion I came to is that iframes can pose a security threats. It is not helpful to the site displaying the iframe for Search Engine Optimization purposes. 
    Lastly I read that iframes can confuse users, since they lose the ability to use the back button while navigating through the iframe. 
    Since this is an iframe hosted on Google, I feel comfortable using this going forward, but I'd like to get feedback from the teachers.</p>
